A privacy-first location-based dapp to share magic places & reward participation. Every upvote, like button, star, follower etc is powered by an underlying token and early customers who help build those products are actually going to participate in the upside. Take note that tokens are currently NOT transferable, they might be swapped to an equivalent transferrable token at a later stage, once the DAO will reach maturity. Owning these tokens makes you a member and lets you participate in the DAO’s governance votes and proposing votes of their own. Want to join? https://livethelife.tv/join/  

# LTL-Maps-React-Native
[![Donate with Ethereum](https://en.cryptobadges.io/badge/micro/0xF6E8156B3001C177C6aA35D90F7D643FF52a960d)](https://en.cryptobadges.io/donate/0xF6E8156B3001C177C6aA35D90F7D643FF52a960d)

We are currently working on the backend code of our MVP. Below are some thoughts and ideas about Web3 & DeFi tools to tokenize media, travel & real estate. You can read more on (https://www.livethelife.tv). Next challenge: legal framework and pre-seed fundraising. As much as we love the roadmap below, if you read up on https://fairmint.co/ you can see that today there is solution that is plug & play. The catch: we need to qualify to use the fairmint platform. So we need to consider USA incorporation, before we deploy.    

# UI/UX Interface

Rather than competing against former Web2 platforms, we will use the Abridged SDK to build a layer on top of the DAO to enhance the UX. This means creating systems that limit the change in user behavior, and make group decisions, manage resources (money) within Whatsapp, Telegram or any messenger platform.

The principal innovation of crypto networks is their ability to grow network effects by enabling users to share in the value they create. With each new database entry, or user, the service becomes more valuable to each individual user, generating a network effect. Valuable crypto services now have the unique opportunity to redistribute that value directly to the users who generate it. Designed correctly, an effective distribution of a fee stream can further entrench network effects by giving users a direct economic incentive to contribute, generating more defensibility, which in turn, reinforces the viability of the fee stream in the first place. 

# Token - $LTL

LTL is an ERC-20 token. It will be used to stake in the system, and as a governance token when the governance module is launched. As it conforms to the ERC-20 standard, the $LTL token will be tradeable on any exchange and storable on any wallet - allowing anyone in the world to access it.

# Distribution

The challenge is getting enough revenue soon enough, for teams to be able to keep contributing. Revenue generation can draw on ideas from Web1 & Web2 businesses — but with less extractive rates. Importantly, the token must be designed such that its value rises as usage rises. But there’s still one big problem: too little revenue, too late. I’ll elaborate. If rates are too high, it will either get forked and re-deployed with lower rates, or it won’t get adopted because it’s seen as too extractive. If rates are too low (and usage isn’t sufficient) then revenue is too low. Either way, teams won’t have enough funding to keep growing the project. They will stoically or heroically keep going for a while, until they can’t feed their family. Some may pull through. And most will be forced to stop, at which point the project begins its fade into oblivion. Good news! We can overcome the challenge of “too little revenue, too late”. It takes a key change: rather than disburse all the tokens at the beginning of the project, disburse a large fraction of tokens over a much longer period of time to the workers that are adding value to the project. This gives teams a longer runway to iterate towards product-market fit (PMF), and more funds to catalyze growth once PMF is achieved.

The distribution breakdown is designed to facilitate the most decentralized protocol and make sure power doesn’t reside in the hands of a few. To show our long-term commitment to the project we decided to send most of the team and advisor tokens to a retention wallet where they will be locked for 5 years.

Content Ambassadors: as a rewards Content Ambassadors should get X amount of $LTL for an article written or piece of contet provided and the reach that piece of content is generating (likes on medium, views on youtube, etc. (TBD). Content Ambassadors should have as well a custom link which allows to be identified that they have been bringing a new user and they should get rewarded for this as well. 

Liquidity Ambassadors: Liquidity is important for a healthy market and community. Without liquidity we have to deal with too much slippage. Providing liquidity carries as well risks, but it is necessary so I would suggest to incentivize the community for providing liquidity on Uniswap by rewardig them with tokens! Something like x% for continious liquidity at a minimum period of x days. Liquidity mining, is a community-based, data-driven approach to market making, in which a token issuer or exchange can reward a pool of miners to provide liquidity for a specified token. 

Token could be launched via a ~2 week liquidity mining phase, using the increasingly popular "fair launch" model; no pre-sale, no VC allocation, and open access for everyone. Anyone can mine by staking Uniswap LP tokens. It should be noted that 10% of all newly minted Tokens could be allocated to a development fund for code, design and content - essentially putting it into the hands of its creator(s) to be used at their discretion. With vesting being the key.

If pools suffer from a lack of liquidity = large fluctuations in price with low volume . Health of any project can be determined by their liquidity . To improve this , it would be optimal for $LTL to be provided to LP’s on both balancer and uniswap . This along with market place mining would lead to more wider distribution and also put the tokens held in wallets into the liquidity pools.

# Governance

The $LTL token will be the system’s governance token, empowering $LTL holders to vote on updates to the platform. Combining governance mechanisms and incentivizing holders, it will serve as a means to align the different stakeholders in the system. $LTL will also serve as a security and policy management medium. Decentralized, automated governance, that incentivizes participants and aims for security, sustainability, and participant welfare is key to a protocol’s success.

Benefits of Conviction Voting:
People with large stakes and strong opinions can’t suppress minority voters
The support a proposal needs to pass is proportional to its budget
The majority doesn’t need to achieve consensus on every proposal
Token holders can simply focus on the proposals they support

Discord is for for support, features requests, and initial development ideas. We recommend to share ideas & discuss questions here on Discord first, before submitting a proposal to the governance form on Aragon. How to submit your proposal

1) Come up with an idea. Promote it: Got an idea? Awesome –– now, go advocate! Initiate a discussion in Discord. Convince other participants to support you, get them to express their voice & upvote. Hear feedback. Make sure that your proposal will make the platform better for everyone.
2) Create your proposal pitch: Summary [what is being proposed?] Motivation [why do you want this implemented? how the community will benefit from it? offer convincing arguments] How it can be implemented? How difficult it is? Other points to consider, pictures and images. Mention your credentials & the number of $LTL you hold for other community members. To submit an official proposal, you can’t be anonymous.
3) Get feedback from the team: If your idea clicked with the community, and we see active interest and feedback, the request is granted the “proposal candidate” status. At this point, the team evaluates if implementing the idea is technically possible at the moment.
4) Vote: The proposal is put for a final vote

# DAO First Approach

LiveTheLifeTV is taking a “DAO First Approach” to spinning up the protocol, choosing to use decentralized tools from the start to achieve our final goal of complete decentralization and having a flexible smart contract system able to add / upgrade / remove functionality all based on DAO proposals. There will be an incubator DAO called MVP FUND DAO & the final protocol DAO called LiveTheLifeTV DAO.

DAOs are organizations that run on peer-to-peer software backbones and empower groups of people to make non-hierarchical decisions about shared resources, like funds. DAOs are a technology that empowers communities to organize together quickly and efficiently.

## Decentralized ≠ chaotic

Nature is beautiful. It's chaotic, yet perfect. There's no central point of control, but things work. There's order in the universe. Good DAOs are similar. There should be freedom of motion and members should have agency, but within a system that aligns incentives. Freedom to join, exit, and fork are essential. Without this you have a walled garden, but with this you have a thriving and diverse ecosystem. Diversity means that one thing is not like the other, which can lead to positive-sum relationships where we aren't both fighting over the same thing, but are working together in a way that's synergistic.

## Autonomous ≠ automated

An autonomous organization can steer itself. If that organization is made up of people, we are part of the system. It's like a spaceship: we steer the spaceship, but then we go where it goes. Us and it have to be in alignment. If we want to go left, but the ship goes right that's a problem. Maintaining the alignment of DAO members and the DAO requires:

- value alignment
- skin in the game
- informed governance

Most DAOs will only have two and a half of these. That's ok, but understanding where you're lacking will help you understand how to bring things into alignment. If you want your DAO to go far this alignment is often more important than anything else, esp initially.

## Organization ≠ bureaucratic

Good DAOs are fun. They spark joy. If you don't have this, no one will put up with the trials and tribulations of Web3 technology and decentralized governance. The system needs to adapt to the needs of members, not the other way around. If you find yourself adapting your workflows in awkward ways to adapt to the limitations of your DAO you're doing it wrong. The structure of your should evolve as the needs and goals of the members evolve. Adapt or die.

# MVP FUND DAO

Starting with MVP FUND DAO, the Founders, Seeders, and Advisors are using an Aragon DAO Company Template which uses transferable tokens to represent ownership stake. Decisions are made based on stake-weighted voting. The native token of the Launch DAO will be $LTLVOTE. The Founders will receive 45%, Seeders will receive 45%, and Advisors will get 10%. The support will be set to 62%, which means more than 62% of the voting shares need to be present at a vote. The minimum will be set to 62%, meaning for a proposal to be passed it must be approved by at least 62%.

The funds from the seeders and the initial supply of the $LTL token will be kept in the MVP FUND DAO treasury. MVP FUND DAO will also have Aragon Agent activated and we will possibly develop integrations for Uniswap pool allocation and Balancer pool allocation control directly into the DAO.

# LiveTheLifeTV DAO

LiveTheLifeTV DAO will be the DAO that is controlled by the $LTL community. The LiveTheLifeTV DAO will have full control over the protocol and the features that are built into it. 

# First DAO Charter

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is an alpha release of a potential model DAO Charter for the DAO's wishing to function as unincorporated association. https://livethelife.tv/dao/

# Abridged Experiment

The Abridged.io/Collab.land service allows for higher quality communities like Karma DAO. The DAO will exist to control, govern, manage, and direct all decisions on behalf of the token holders. This includes strategic decisions, as well as operational maintenance such as paying developers. 

Step 1: Explore and setup the collab.land bot on TG & Discord
Step2: Connect the bot with Metamask.
Step3: Set up an Aragon DAO (Gardens Template) on xDAI/testnet to avoid the crazy high fees.
Step4: Join the DAO! One must hold 10.000 LTL Tokens in their MetaMask wallet. The bot will verify ownership of tokens. The early members that join get the first 10.000 LTL Tokens Airdropped as a gift for sending feedback about the current UX
Step5: Start working on ways to earn & tip LTL tokens. First in the TG & Discord, later in the LTL Maps & LTL Media app
Step6: The LTL Token will hold real value in ETH as soon as it gets listed on Uniswap and liquidity pool is ready. Get advice from Raid Guild and Lex_DAO / LAO before we commit to adding real ETH value to the token. For now, the token can not be bought it must be earned. The top priority is to test onchain DAO interaction within TG/Discord and our RN app
Step7: All proceeds from the LTL Membership token sales will be used as liquiditiy for members who do wish to sell their tokens and exit. Price = the current price based on the number of members since they joined. (A bonding curve schedule where the price grows as the group gets bigger)

Example to tribute the first 10K DAI

1. Go to the page via this link; sign-in with Web3 via your wallet with the upper right “Sign In=>” link and click on the “Sign In with Web3” button. It supports both Metamask as well as Coinbase Wallet access. 2. Click on the “New Proposal” button on the upper right, and then the “Member” link to submit a Membership proposal. 3. Unlock LTL tokens: Click on the “unlock” button and accept the transaction; wait for the transaction to complete. This allows the dApp to use LTL in your wallet. 4. Complete the simple form, starting with the title including your name or handle. E.g.- “Membership proposal #1: Yves VdM”
In the Short Description, write us a message. E.g.- “Propose to have Yves VdM join the DAO” In the Link section, you can include your social media profile — Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. Hit “Submit” and join the LiveTheLifeTV Discord via this link. Go to the introductions channel, tell us a bit more about yourself, and announce that you’ve pledged to join the experiment!

Here's a great example of how to use both time & money to split up the cake during an early experiment: "An investor invests 10.000 USD with a risk multiplier of 20x, it will receive 2'00.000 FDAI tokens. An engineer works for 6 months on the project at a virtual rate of 10,000 USD per month and with a risk multiplier of 20x too, that person will receive 1'200.000 FDAI tokens. These economic rights usually come (but don't need to) with governance rights on the Executive DAO, which is defined by a third token called EGT, or executive governance tokens. All the revenue generated will then be held on the Executive DAO as cash. Once a cash-limit is reached, all the additional revenue must be used to pay back FDAI holders at a rate of 1 DAI for each FDAI token and burning any associated EGT token."

The council acts as the project team being funded by the fundraising campaign. Council members are represented through a custom token and enforce their decisions via a dedicated voting app that acts similarly to a traditional multisig account. Their privileges are intentionally limited to protect token holders. https://livethelife.tv/the-fundraising-template/ Aragon Fundraising is a suite of Aragon apps providing Aragon organizations continuous fundraising capabilities. It enables users to buy and redeem one organization's token through an automated market maker automatically matching orders according to a bonding curve tied to the Bancor formula. The funds held by this market maker reserve pool are released over time into a discretionary pool controlled by the organization's board to sustain the project. 

Take Note; We now see https://github.com/BarnBridge/ as another mindset to fork

# Development Introduction

The following section describes the MVP / Beta release of the product, which will help inform the product development direction, allow us to start collecting data and ensure the product is aligned with what the market needs.

We are determined to provide a great user experience for users, making sure previous pools are visible and our community can make a well informed decision about when and how to join in. However, we expect the community to build some of the analytics which will accompany the core product. We welcome this development as it will provide more insight into the product.

Through the decentralized governance, member-driven model, we hope to provide rules for and manage the following:
Collect & Manage Funds
Curate/Commission Places to Live The Life
Mint Tokens
Collect/Distribute Royalties
Establish/Update Policies
Provide Transparency
Reward Code, Design and Content

# Components & Timelines

#aragon  - Governance and Decision-Making?
#sourcecred  - Tracking and Rewarding Contributions?
#abridged  - Onboarding and Navigation?
#parachute - Liquidity Mining

# MVP FUND DAO

We will use the community contracts based on Aragon DAO Company Template to create the base of the core DAO. Because the contracts have already been in production for so long, we trust the functionality and features they provide. We expect to do minimum changes to the initial source code. However, we will create tests for our most common use cases, make sure the user flow makes sense and the users have an easy UX to join in the DAO.

    Estimated time to build, test and launch: 6 weeks

# LiveTheLifeTV DAO

This subsequent DAO might need to have multiple specific functionality that the Aragon DAO Company Template does not already have. The LiveTheLifeTV DAO will become the core component of the LTL Platform because it will be able to make decisions in a decentralized manner that will be able to enforce the best actions for the wellness of the community.

    Estimated time to build, test and launch on testnet: 6 weeks

An additional external audit will push the launch on the mainnet by approximately 4 weeks. 

    Estimated time to build, test and launch on the testnet (including the oracle system): 12 weeks

An additional external audit will push the launch on the mainnet by approximately 6 weeks. 

###
You earn points for contributions. (off-chain)
This then earns you tokens according to a payout strategy. (on-chain)
Token balances are tracked in an on-chain ledger. (DAO)
There is a market for people to buy and sell tokens. (a bonding curve as well as secondary exchanges)
People can use their tokens for things on-chain. (Moloch, Colony, DeFi, etc...)
People may or may not also be able to use tokens for in-game features/rewards, but to do they might have to burn, stake, or trade their tokens. (dependent on the use case of each project)
###

# LTL MEDIA V1

A magazine owned and governed by the contributors and readers. Where contributors submit articles, photos and videos. And where readers interested in participating in the curation of the magazine buy tokens on a bonding curve and stake on articles that get submitted. When contributors submit an article, they are also submitting a request for payment. If their submission reaches a support threshold they will be rewarded by the DAO. The magazine will explore the Unlock protocol for membership subscriptions. Contributors get shares of governance and profit.  Readers could subscribe for a base price, but could also pay a higher tier into a reserve pool, which grants them profit share and governance ability. So, revenue is split between the common pool and the bonding curve reserve, to reward both contributors and curators.

Tokens can be issued (minted and burned) continuously via a bonding curve. Revenue would be split between the reward pool (used to reward content, code, and design) and the bonding curve reserve (used to reward photos, videos, likes, shares, notes, etc ...). The Community DAO uses the tokens of the Company DAO as the collateral/currency, giving participants a stake in the ecosystem, but also allows the Company DAO to focus on its mission. 

Users can submit places and content as a "conviction voting proposal", if the content reaches the threshold then it is "featured" and the submitter will be paid a reward from the DAO funds. A membership protocol, built on a blockchain can enable creators to monetize their content. It lets consumers manage all of their subscriptions in a consistent way, as well as earn discounts when they share the content on social media channels. Contributors could get shares of governance and profit.  Readers could subscribe for a base price, but could also pay a higher tier into a reserve pool, which grants them profit share and governance ability.

The essential point to grasp is that the token model directly links the usage of the network to the value of the token
subscription is a creator to audience relationship, but it's hard to build a community (fans can't create value), tokenized access is a membership model: everyone wants to share and make the community more valuable (meritocratic media network)

# LTL TRAVEL V2

We are building a privacy-first location-based dapp to share magic places with real friends. Dedicated to the vision of web3, we are buidling a mobile app owned and governed by the contributors and users. A dapp, to publish, explore, and share places to Live The Life. We change the user experience by surfacing content on your timeline, based on your current location. A platform for travel-loving creators to upload original content can be beneficial to those considering a vacation — while being rewarding for storytellers.

Unlock features based on location. Delivering location-based customer experiences at the right time. Using geofences to represent restaurants, indicating whether they are open, pickup-only, or closed. Geofence places to sleep, understand when customers enter and exit these locations, and deliver personalized communications and in-app experiences. Encourages them to check out recommended activities. Provide promotions and helpful information as travelers arrive at these locations.

Similar to Swarm, allow users to get rewarded for visiting real-world locations, as they can earn tokens through a process called geo-mining. This model allows businesses to attract potential customers to their locations, get their attention or even get them to perform storytelling challenges. Businesses pay only for people that visit their place which make calculation of Return of Investment easy. 

Incentivise anyone using the LTL Maps app to travel to a location, and get rewarded for spending quality time. Experimentation and iteration will be required to optimize the model and establish best practices. We explore the idea of having LTL Maps and it's Community to be owned and developed by two Aragon DAO's with a legal wrapper.

# LTL REAL ESTATE V3

While we focus on the launch of our online magazine and the new LTL Maps App, we have never made it a secret that our endgame is to tokenize LTL Eco Pods. When an asset owner decides to tokenize a property, an Ethereum-standard (ERC20) real estate token (also called a security token) is created to represent shares of the property. The total value of all tokens will be equivalent to the total value of the securitized asset. (PDF Deloitte / Tokeny: Tokenized real estate)

Tokens entitle their respective holder to a right of participation. Token holders will be entitled to a pro rata (based on token holdings) split of of revenue, subject to proper Registration and KYC/AML. Revenue will be distributed to token holders quarterly. The actual amount to be paid out will be equal to the pro rata quarterly revenue participation amount minus possible transaction costs minus possible withholding taxes. We will limit the share offering to a certain percentage of the asset – say 80%, to retain some ownership while raising funds for a new surf/snow real estate project. 

Tokenized real estate tokens are technically shares of a company, by wrapping it inside of a legal entity, an LLC, ownership of the LLC is then defined as a specific batch of ERC20 tokens. By whitelisting the Uniswap Exchange address, it is possible to enable access to the Uniswap application and enjoy the benefits of liquidity. A listing inside of Uniswap is significant because it represents a security token operating inside of an Ethereum financial application, while still retaining compliance. All compliance logic that’s ‘baked-in’ to tokens is unchained by its integration with Uniswap.

We plan to develop an eco resort starting with eight LTL Pods. Including creative office spaces to let your inner artist escape into sublime. Originally envisaged as a pop-up hotel room or Airbnb accommodation, the two-person prefab ÖÖD dwellings are made from steel, insulated glass and wood, and takes less than eight hours to build. In partnership with French startup myfood we want to add smart greenhouses that can grow up to 400 kilograms (22 sqm) of organic fruits and vegetables a year with only a few hours of work a week. Combining permaculture principles with smart technology to monitor plant health, the smart greenhouses aim to change people’s relationships with food as a means of reducing the global carbon footprint.  

The complimentary back-end and front-end.

    Estimated time to build, test and launch: 20 weeks

An additional external audit will push the launch on the mainnet by approximately 6 weeks.

# Smart Contracts

Because we want to have a completely decentralized system, our whole infrastructure is based around a community driven DAO. The DAO will be the owner of the core contracts of the system and will be able to define what the contracts are able to do.

To keep the core philosophy of having a completely decentralized system, we will use a decentralized oracle system such as Chainlink. This will allow us to do off-chain computation that can be later used on-chain. Of course this off-chain system can be replaced and upgraded by the DAO.

# Audit & Simulations

# Post-MVP

The post MVP, or the next release of the product will have the mainnet release as its highlight. 

# Future Work

# Gas Fees

As multiple operations with different gas costs are necessary, these fees can add up pretty quickly. There are layer 2 solutions that would increase scalability and allow for complex operations and large numbers of transfers while simultaneously reducing associated costs. A potential solution that has already hit mainnet (looking at you Loopring) are zk rollups - which at a high level involve the bundling up transfers into a single transaction. Most of the computations are done off chain, and enforced through validity proofs. Moving the heavy lifting off-chain allows for much higher throughput, keeps costs lower, and - just as importantly - doesn’t sacrifice security. For an app that targets large numbers of active users, a solution aimed at scalability is the way to go.
