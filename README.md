Position-dependent applications can prove that a customer has arrived at your restaurant or hotel so that the smart contract can trigger a reward.

A privacy-first location-based dapp to share magic places & reward participation. Every upvote, like button, star, follower etc is powered by an underlying token and early customers who help build those products are actually going to participate in the upside. Take note that tokens are currently NOT transferable, they might be swapped to an equivalent transferrable token at a later stage, once the DAO will reach maturity. Owning these tokens makes you a member and lets you participate in the DAO‚Äôs governance votes and proposing votes of their own. Want to join? https://livethelife.tv/

We are currently working on the backend code of our MVP. Below are some thoughts and ideas about Web3 & DeFi tools to tokenize media, travel & real estate. You can read more on (https://www.livethelife.tv). Next challenge: legal framework and pre-seed fundraising. As much as we love the roadmap below, if you read up on https://fairmint.co/ you can see that today there is solution that is plug & play. The catch: we need to qualify to use the fairmint platform. So we need to consider USA incorporation, before we deploy.    

# UI/UX Interface

Rather than competing against former Web2 platforms, we will use the Abridged SDK to build a layer on top of the DAO to enhance the UX. This means creating systems that limit the change in user behavior, and make group decisions, manage resources (money) within Whatsapp, Telegram or any messenger platform.

The principal innovation of crypto networks is their ability to grow network effects by enabling users to share in the value they create. With each new database entry, or user, the service becomes more valuable to each individual user, generating a network effect. Valuable crypto services now have the unique opportunity to redistribute that value directly to the users who generate it. Designed correctly, an effective distribution of a fee stream can further entrench network effects by giving users a direct economic incentive to contribute, generating more defensibility, which in turn, reinforces the viability of the fee stream in the first place. 

# Token - $GVO

GVO is an ERC-20 token. It will be used to stake in the system, and as a governance token when the governance module is launched. As it conforms to the ERC-20 standard, the $GVO token will be tradeable on any exchange and storable on any wallet - allowing anyone in the world to access it.

# Distribution

The challenge is getting enough revenue soon enough, for teams to be able to keep contributing. Revenue generation can draw on ideas from Web1 & Web2 businesses ‚Äî but with less extractive rates. Importantly, the token must be designed such that its value rises as usage rises. But there‚Äôs still one big problem: too little revenue, too late. I‚Äôll elaborate. If rates are too high, it will either get forked and re-deployed with lower rates, or it won‚Äôt get adopted because it‚Äôs seen as too extractive. If rates are too low (and usage isn‚Äôt sufficient) then revenue is too low. Either way, teams won‚Äôt have enough funding to keep growing the project. They will stoically or heroically keep going for a while, until they can‚Äôt feed their family. Some may pull through. And most will be forced to stop, at which point the project begins its fade into oblivion. Good news! We can overcome the challenge of ‚Äútoo little revenue, too late‚Äù. It takes a key change: rather than disburse all the tokens at the beginning of the project, disburse a large fraction of tokens over a much longer period of time to the workers that are adding value to the project. This gives teams a longer runway to iterate towards product-market fit (PMF), and more funds to catalyze growth once PMF is achieved.

# Governance

The $GVO token will be the system‚Äôs governance token, empowering $GVO holders to vote on updates to the platform. Combining governance mechanisms and incentivizing holders, it will serve as a means to align the different stakeholders in the system. $GVO will also serve as a security and policy management medium. Decentralized, automated governance, that incentivizes participants and aims for security, sustainability, and participant welfare is key to a protocol‚Äôs success.

# DAO First Approach

LiveTheLifeTV is taking a ‚ÄúDAO First Approach‚Äù to spinning up the protocol, choosing to use decentralized tools from the start to achieve our final goal of complete decentralization and having a flexible smart contract system able to add / upgrade / remove functionality all based on DAO proposals. 

# Development Introduction

The following section describes the MVP / Beta release of the product, which will help inform the product development direction, allow us to start collecting data and ensure the product is aligned with what the market needs.

We are determined to provide a great user experience for users, making sure previous pools are visible and our community can make a well informed decision about when and how to join in. However, we expect the community to build some of the analytics which will accompany the core product. We welcome this development as it will provide more insight into the product.

Through the decentralized governance, member-driven model, we hope to provide rules for and manage the following:
Collect & Manage Funds
Curate/Commission Places to Live The Life
Mint Tokens
Collect/Distribute Royalties
Establish/Update Policies
Provide Transparency
Reward Code, Design and Content

# TRAVEL V3.3

We are building a privacy-first location-based dapp to share magic places with real friends. Dedicated to the vision of web3, we are buidling a mobile app owned and governed by the contributors and users. A dapp, to publish, explore, and share places to Live The Life. We change the user experience by surfacing content on your timeline, based on your current location. A platform for travel-loving creators to upload original content can be beneficial to those considering a vacation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhile being rewarding for storytellers.

Unlock features based on location. Delivering location-based customer experiences at the right time. Using geofences to represent restaurants, indicating whether they are open, pickup-only, or closed. Geofence places to sleep, understand when customers enter and exit these locations, and deliver personalized communications and in-app experiences. Encourages them to check out recommended activities. Provide promotions and helpful information as travelers arrive at these locations.

Similar to Swarm, allow users to get rewarded for visiting real-world locations, as they can earn tokens through a process called geo-mining. This model allows businesses to attract potential customers to their locations, get their attention or even get them to perform storytelling challenges. Businesses pay only for people that visit their place which make calculation of Return of Investment easy. 

Incentivise anyone using the LTL Maps app to travel to a location, and get rewarded for spending quality time. Experimentation and iteration will be required to optimize the model and establish best practices. We explore the idea of having LTL Maps and it's Community to be owned and developed by two Aragon DAO's with a legal wrapper.

# Smart Contracts

Because we want to have a completely decentralized system, our whole infrastructure is based around a community driven DAO. The DAO will be the owner of the core contracts of the system and will be able to define what the contracts are able to do.

To keep the core philosophy of having a completely decentralized system, we will use a decentralized oracle system such as Chainlink. This will allow us to do off-chain computation that can be later used on-chain. Of course this off-chain system can be replaced and upgraded by the DAO.

# Gas Fees

As multiple operations with different gas costs are necessary, these fees can add up pretty quickly. There are layer 2 solutions that would increase scalability and allow for complex operations and large numbers of transfers while simultaneously reducing associated costs. A potential solution that has already hit mainnet (looking at you Loopring) are zk rollups - which at a high level involve the bundling up transfers into a single transaction. Most of the computations are done off chain, and enforced through validity proofs. Moving the heavy lifting off-chain allows for much higher throughput, keeps costs lower, and - just as importantly - doesn‚Äôt sacrifice security. For an app that targets large numbers of active users, a solution aimed at scalability is the way to go.
