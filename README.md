A mobile app can prove that a customer has arrived at your restaurant or hotel so that the smart contract can trigger a reward.

Update: we closed down the project at the start of Covid19. Keen to revisit this idea (get help with backend/wallet integration)

# THE IDEA

Similar to Swarm, allow users to get rewarded for visiting real-world locations, as they can earn tokens through a process called geo-mining. This model allows businesses to attract potential customers to their locations, get their attention or even get them to perform storytelling challenges. Businesses pay only for people that visit their place which make calculation of Return of Investment easy. Incentivise anyone using the LTL Maps app to travel to a location, and get rewarded for spending quality time. Experimentation and iteration will be required to optimize the model and establish best practices. 

# Smart Contracts

To keep the core philosophy of having a completely decentralized system, we will use a decentralized oracle system such as Chainlink. This will allow us to do off-chain computation that can be later used on-chain. Of course this off-chain system can be replaced and upgraded by the DAO.

# Gas Fees

As multiple operations with different gas costs are necessary, these fees can add up pretty quickly. There are layer 2 solutions that would increase scalability and allow for complex operations and large numbers of transfers while simultaneously reducing associated costs. A potential solution that has already hit mainnet are zk rollups /OP - which at a high level involve the bundling up transfers into a single transaction. Most of the computations are done off chain, and enforced through validity proofs. Moving the heavy lifting off-chain allows for much higher throughput, keeps costs lower, and - just as importantly - doesnâ€™t sacrifice security. For an app that targets large numbers of active users, a solution aimed at scalability is the way to go.
